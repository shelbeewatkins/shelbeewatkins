    <strong> About This Site </strong><br/>
    <em>CV anticipation</em><br/>
   Hi, I created this site because I am passionate about both Molecular Biology and <br/>
   Microbiology, and eventually I want to get a phD in that and then to continue in Academia.<br/>
   I have seen several researches who have made websites to display the papers they published.<br/>
   Sadly, I am only a freshman in college and have not been published, but I have a website ready for when I do. <br/>
  </p>
  <br/>

    <strong>My Major</strong><br/>
    <em> Microbiology</em><br/>
    Originally, I wanted to be a veterinarian. I even was admitted into the early acceptance program<br/>
    at Kansas State University's College of Veterinary Medicine. To become more involved, I began to work<br/>
    in a research lab at the Vet school. The lab focuses mostly on Molecular Biology. We are trying to understand <br/>
    how bacteria infects the host and how we can prevent that without the ue of antibiotics. Due to this, I am going<br/>
    to major in Microbiology or Biochemistry.

    <strong>My Minor</strong><br/>
   <em> Computer Science </em><br/>
   I started taking Computer Science classes because my friend is majoring in Computer Science was working<br/>
    on some code and I was able to point out one missing semicolon that fixed the code he was struggling on.<br/>
    My interest started with finding the puzzle aspect fun, but it increased when I realized the practical aspects of it.<br/>
    Recently, my lab has come to a standstill because we cannot afford to test a molecule that inhibits our target protein,<br/>
    because the molecule is made by Kansas University and they charge too much money for it. So my lab asked me to help<br/>
    find analagous molecules as a way to work around this problem. I used a pipelining tool to search for molecular similarity.<br/>
    This opened my eyes to the world of both Bioinformatics and Chemoinformatics, so that is when I decided to<br/>
    start a minor in Computer Science. <br/>
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    <strong>Extra</strong><br/>
    <em>Just a little more about me</em><br/>
    I am very much a pet person with a pit-lab mix and a bearded dragon. On top of this I raise and breed dubia roaches<br/>
    to feed my bearded dragon. I also really like to cook and I am a vegetarian. I am excited about CIS 200 next semester,<br/>
    because I want to do more programming, but I am sad that it is not in Python. I am most interested in Python, because<br/>
    that seems to be the most popular in Bio and Chemoinformatics. <br/>
