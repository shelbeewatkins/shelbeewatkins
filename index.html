<!--This is a website using mostly CSS and HTML. Most of the website was created by myself for the purpose of
having a place to put my published papers eventually, but also as a way to practice and learn html.
Just to clarify, everything I did with HTML and CSS was almost all my doing. The JS for the buttons I had help with.
I also had some help making my photos circular. Just a few notes, I have anchored a link to the about me page at the bottom
of the site, but it is probably just easier to click the button. The Resume is in XML, because embedding a PDF seemed
to tedious. My contact page does not work yet, but I am still working on how to make it work. The javascript for the tic-tac-toe board is my own work.
The embedded video is on my portfolio page. It is a youtube video of a screen recording of a video I made for this year's Game Jam.
I also have a link to twitter and instagram on my contact page but that was with some help, while the youtube video was on my own. -->

    <strong> My Background</strong><br/> <!-- The strong tag makes it bold and <br/> creates a new line. I use that a lot, because the homework asked for it and I just prefer that style.-->
