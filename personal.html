  <p>Hi! My name is Shelby Watkins. I am currently pursuing a B.S in Medical Biochemistry. I am also pursuing a minor in Computer Science.
    I hope to combine these in the future and allow my programming skills to enhance the science I do. I currently work in a Research Lab in a Molecular Biology lab at the College of Veterinary Medicine.
    My hobbys lately have included programming, writing, and photography. In terms of programming, I am focusing on improving my skills in Python, HTML, and CSS. In terms of science, I have become extremely interested in
    bacteria. They are such small units of life, but yet they have so much influence in everyone's life. When I am not bent over the computer reading scientific articles or programming, I am out hiking or curled up on the couch reading.
    I have a lot of pets back home in Atlanta, Georgia. However, the only one I was allowed to bring with me was my bearded dragon, Ezra. I adopted him from a kid who had little interest in him, and I am constantly fascinated
    when learning about reptiles and their specifities. I am also currently in the process of increasing my fluency in both German and Spanish. I look forward to maximizing my communication skills as much as possible. If you have any questions or
    comments on what I am doing, feel free to shoot me an email to discuss!
  </p>
